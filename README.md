# What is this?
It's a port of the Godot open source game engine to the Switch, via homebrew libraries provided by devkitPro/switchbrew.
See the original README-original.md for info about Godot.

# Releases
See [https://9net.org/godot/editors/](https://9net.org/godot/editors/) for pre-built editors for Windows, macOS and Linux.

# How do I export my game?
The editor builds above add a `Switch` exporter to the list - it will generate a .nro and a .pck file that can be transferred to your Switch.
If additional debugging is required, sending the nro via nxlink (make sure to send it to the right place with the -p argument) will allow the output of the console to be viewed on PC.

# How to build?
You shouldn't need to build the engine if you use a release as the templates should be included - these instructions are for development!

Install these packages from devkitPro pacman:  
`switch-pkg-config switch-freetype switch-bulletphysics switch-libtheora switch-libpcre2 switch-mesa switch-opusfile switch-mbedtls switch-libwebp switch-libvpx switch-miniupnpc`  
then run `scons platform=switch` in the root of the repo.
